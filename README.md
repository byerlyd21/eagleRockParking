This repo stores the code and timeline for my Eagle Rock parking project, my thoughts as well as the overall summary.


# Summary
Eagle Rock Properties is in need of a way to organize some information relating to parking, vehicles, as well as storage units. 
They do not have a software that makes this information easily accessable, especially the garage units. If an employee wants to 
know which resident a garage is being rented by, the information is hard to access. If they want to know which car is whos, they 
will have to check their current software tennant by tennant to find the person. The goal of this program is to make the 
search for this information much easier. This will also be a place that employees are able to add new residents, and delete old
residents. It will store car make, model, year, licesnse plate number, licesence plate state, parking sticker code, and garage number
or premiere parking space if applicable. 


# Process
There is a large issue with this programs usefullness to the company, because they currently use a different program to store information.
If the other software is updated, my program is not. This means that every time a resident moves in, or out their data will change. This
deducts from my datas accuracy. If someone searchs up a resident and they do not come up because my website has not been updated, the
program is esentially useless. I will also not be working here forever, so I will not be able to update the information. Updating/adding
new residents to the database will be user firendly, but it will be annoying if it needs to be done every time there are changes to the
other software. If someting is being done already, why do it again? I had wanted to use its API to fetch the data, but my company does not
use the softwares online version. They have paid for the desktop version that does not have API access. Instead I plan to have an option,
where users can upload a csv file of information from the renting software that contains all of the parking information needed. The user
will still need to update the garage info manually, but this won't be a very big issue because there are only 10 garages as opposed to over 500 parking spaces. This will make the program easy to use long after I leave.
