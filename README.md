# eagleRockParking
This repo stores the code and timeline for my Eagle Rock parking project, my thoughts as well as the overall summary.

Eagle Rock Properties is in need of a way to organize some information relating to parking, vehicles, as well as storage units. 
They do not have a software that makes this information easily accessable, especially the garage units. If an employee wants to 
know which resident a garage is being rented by, the information is hard to access. If they want to know which car is whos, they 
will have to check their current software tennant by tennant to find the person. The goal of this program is to make the 
search for this information much easier. This will also be a place that employees are able to add new residents, and delete old
residents. It will store car make, model, year, licesnse plate number, licesence plate state, parking sticker code, and garage number
or premiere parking space if applicable.
